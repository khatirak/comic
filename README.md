# Project Name: Leaf It To Me!

## Project Description:
This project is a comic website inspired by the popular Plants vs. Zombies video game. Our goal was to create an engaging and humorous storyline while delivering a meaningful message. Through engaging dialogue and entertaining visuals, we explore the idea that true strength comes in different forms.  
By combining storytelling, illustration, sound, and web development, we aimed to make the comic both fun to read and thought-provoking. Readers can enjoy the lighthearted rivalry between Sunflower and Peashooter while also reflecting on the deeper lesson.

## Process:
To begin, the comic theme was developed, focusing on the core moral of the story. Next, the narrative was shaped, ensuring the message to be clear and impactful. Once the storyline was in place, attention was turned to the website design, deciding on the layout, image creation, and how to make the site more interactive for viewers. The roles were efficiently assigned as outlined below:

- *Deema – Storyline & Documentation*  
  Responsible for developing the storyline, ensuring a smooth flow of events from one panel to the next. Worked on distributing the caption and descriptions for each panel, and creating two alternate endings. Also managed the documentation, ensuring all key details were recorded.
  
- *Guli – Storyline & Documentation & Sounds*  
  Expanded on the story’s moral message and contributed to the documentation. Sourced and selected appropriate sound effects to enhance the comic’s engagement.
  
- *Khatira – Website & GitHub*  
  Handled the coding and development of the website, ensuring the layout and functionality matched the team’s vision. Managed the GitHub repository and integrated captions, backgrounds, and overall website design.
  
- *Nigina – Illustration & Visual Design*  
  Came up with the theme for the project and created hand-drawn illustrations for each panel, ensuring the visuals aligned with the storyline. Focused on maintaining consistency in design and enhancing the storytelling experience through engaging artwork.

## Reflection/Evaluation:
The final version stayed true to our vision, effectively delivering the story in a fun and engaging way. Seeing the comic come to life on the website was especially rewarding. We successfully balanced storytelling, artwork, and presentation.
